This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


For Further Development:

Create user teams to assign goals to specific teams.

Have a feed of signed in users and assign goals to specific users.

Add a forgot password link that routes to another page where the user can use the firebase reset password method to change their authentication information.

Delete completed goals individually rather than clearing them all at once.
